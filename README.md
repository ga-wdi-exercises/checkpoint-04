## Instructions

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Fill in your answers by writing in the appropriate area or, for multiple-choice questions, placing an 'x' in the square brackets.
4. Add/Commit/Push your changes to Github.
5. Open a pull request.

For questions 1-4, you must test your code before filling in an answer. You can do this by creating and running your own `app.rb` file or using an online REPL (e.g., [repl.it](https://repl.it/)).

## Ruby Basics & Enumerables

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here...

```ruby

Def 'offer_rose'
   Puts “Would you take this rose in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold!”
end


```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash...

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}


```

Using Ruby...
- Remove Belle from the town residents
- Add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here...

```ruby
puts "Belle".pop
x = guests
guests << "Belle"
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names...

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` and string interpolation, `puts` the following text...

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here...

```ruby
puts Belle is friends with ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"].each
```

## Ruby OOP

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`. Each `Animal` should have...
- A `name` attribute
- A `greet` instance method
- The ability to "get" and "set" `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba".

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have...
- A `king` attribute which is a boolean
- If the instance's `name` is "Simba" make the `king` attribute `true`

Create a new lion instance with the name "Simba".

```ruby

Class Animal
     Attr_accessor: name, :greeting,
end

Class Lion  <  Animal

Attr_accessor: king,

Lion_instance = Lion.new
Lion_instance.name = "Simba"

End


```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD)...
- Genie
- Lamp
- Person
- Pet

Your answer...

```
The ERD is a graphical representation of an information system that shows the relationship between people, objects, places, concepts or events within that system.

Genie - person, lives in a bottle, grants wishes
Lamp - may house a genie. My provide light and/or decoration
Person - name, age, gender
pet - animal, dog, cat, snake
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use `people` and `wishes` models.

Your answer...

```
A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied on the data.

We reprent 1 to many relationships by drawing the diagram. 
```

### Question 7

Consider a class `Person` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and has the following schema...

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
)
```

Write Ruby code that will create an instance of a person.

Your answer...

```ruby
person_instance = person.new
```

Write Ruby code that will query for any person that is 15 years of age.

Your answer...

```ruby
puts "You're 15 years old" if age is > 15 && if age is < 16
```

### Question 8

Write a route in Sinatra that will print "hello world" in the web browser at the following URL: `http://localhost:4567/oh_hello`

Your answer...

```ruby
get '/oh_hello' do
  return 'hello world'
end
```
