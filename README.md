## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose(person)
  @person = person
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{@person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose("young prince")
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
castle.guests.push("Belle")
residents.pop(1)
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends.each {|this| "Belle is friends with #{this}"}
```
## Ruby OOP (meets Lion King)

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`.
Each `Animal` should have:

- a `name` attribute
- a `greet` instance method
- Getter and setter for `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba"

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class.
The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have:
- a `king` attribute which is a boolean
  - If the instance's `name` is `Simba` make the `king` attribute true

Create a new lion instance with the name `simba`

```ruby
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name

  def greet(name)
    @name = name
    puts "Hello #{@name}"
  end
end

class Lion < Animal
  attr_accessor : pack

  def initialize (name)
    @@pack = [king: 0]
    @name = name
    if @name == "Simba"
      @@pack[:king = 1]
    end
  end
end

simba = Lion.new("Simba")

```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
an ERD is a 'flowchart' that shows the relationships and associations of data between the various components of an overall framework/program.

A lamp has a genie, a person has a lamp, and a person has a pet
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
a schema is a data 'template', which has the various categories and attributes of any data, sorted in some logical relationship, but does not contain any individual inputs of information.

A one to many relationship could be represented in an SQL database by associating many wishes with one person (one ID)
```

### Question 7

Given an active record class `Person`. That inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and the following schema :
```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
)
```

Write ruby code that will create a person.

Your answer:
```
persons.new(name: = Alex, age: = 26)
```

Write ruby code that will query for any person that is 15 years of age

Your answer:
```
persons.each {|person| if person[:age] == 15 return person}
```

### Sinatra

Write a route in sinatra that will print "hello world" in the web browser at the following URL: `http://localhost:4567/oh_hello`

Your answer:
```
get '/oh_hello' do
print "Hello world"
end
```
