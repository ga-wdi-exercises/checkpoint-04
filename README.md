## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose (person)
  puts "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end
offer_rose("young prince")
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
town[:residents].delete("Belle")
town[:castle, :guests] << "Belle"
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
[:friends].each do
  |friend| puts "Belle is friends with #{name}"
end
```
## Ruby OOP (meets Lion King)

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`.
Each `Animal` should have:

- a `name` attribute
- a `greet` instance method
- Getter and setter for `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba"

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class.
The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have:
- a `king` attribute which is a boolean
  - If the instance's `name` is `Simba` make the `king` attribute true

Create a new lion instance with the name `simba`

```ruby
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize name
    @name = name
  end
  def greeter
  puts  "Hello my name is #{name}"
  end
end

pumba = Animal.new("Pumba")

class Lion < Animal
  attr_accessor
  @@pack = []
  def initialize
    @@pack << self
  end
  def greeter
    super;
  end
  def self.pack
    @@pack
  end
  def is_king
    if @name == "Simba"
      return true
  end
end
simba = Lion.new("Simba")
Lion.pack
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An ERD is an entity relationship diagram.  We create ERD's to help determine the
relationships between the data.  An ERD is used to prioritize order and scope.  For the example provided above a Genie has a one to many relationship with people but a one to one relationship with 1 person at any given
time.  Each genie lives in or has one lamp (1:1).
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema is the outline for the table.  It states what will go in each column and
whether they are null, integers or characters. A one to many relationship is represented
by crows feet. For instance if there is one mom who has many children, she will have
a single line from her box and the children will have the crows feet representing
that there are many children.  
```
