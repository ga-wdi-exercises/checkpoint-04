## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose (person)
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose ("young prince")
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby


def move (person)
  town[:castle][:guests] << town[:residents].delete(person)
end

move ('Belle')

```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby

friends.each do |character|
 puts "Belle is friends with #{character}"
end
```

## Ruby OOP (meets Lion King)

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`.
Each `Animal` should have:

- a `name` attribute
- a `greet` instance method
- Getter and setter for `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba"

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class.
The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have:
- a `king` attribute which is a boolean
  - If the instance's `name` is `Simba` make the `king` attribute true

Create a new lion instance with the name `simba`

```ruby

class Animal
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize (name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name}"
  end

end

class Lion < Animal
  @@pack = []

  def king
    if @name == "Simba"
      @king = true
    end
  end

  def self.pack
    @@pack
  end

end


pumba = Animal.new("Pumba")
simba = Lion.new("Simba")


```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
Replace this with your answer
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
Replace this with your answer
```
