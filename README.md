## Ruby Basics & Enumerables

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here...

```ruby
def offer_rose person
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person.to_s}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose 'young prince'
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash...

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby...
- Remove Belle from the town residents
- Add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here...

```ruby
town[:castle][:guests] << town[:residents][1]
town[:residents].slice!(1)
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names...

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` and string interpolation, `puts` the following text...

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here...

```ruby
friends.each do |fren|
  puts "Belle is friends with #{fren.to_s}"
end
```

## Ruby OOP

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`. Each `Animal` should have...
- A `name` attribute
- A `greet` instance method
- The ability to "get" and "set" `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba".

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have...
- A `king` attribute which is a boolean
- If the instance's `name` is "Simba" make the `king` attribute `true`

Create a new lion instance with the name "Simba".

```ruby
class Animal
  attr_accessor :name
  def initialize name
    @name = name
  end
  def greet
    puts "Hi my name is #{@name.to_s}"
  end
end

class Lion < Animal
  attr_accessor :king
  @@pack = []
  def intialize name
    super (name)
    @@pack.push(self)
    if @name == 'simba'
      @king = true
    else
      @king = false
    end
  end
  def self.list
    puts @@pack
  end
  def king
    puts @king
  end
end

# theres a syntax error in here somewhere
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD)...
- Genie
- Lamp
- Person
- Pet

Your answer...

```
An ERD is a diagram showing all the entities, relationships between those entities and properties of those entities in a particular system (at least all those relevant for creating a computer model of the system)
Take Genies, Lamps, and Persons. First of all there will probably be a one to one relationship between between genies and lamps (one genie to a lamp) a one to many relationship between persons and lamps (one person can have many lamps) and (somewhat redundantly) a one to many relationship between persons and genies. next there will probably be a some characteristics of the genies, the lamps and the people. For instance, the genies might have a 'years_in_captivity' trait with a integer or float as a value, the person might have a 'name' trait with a string as a value, the lamps might have a 'price' trait with a float as a value and so on...

```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use `people` and `wishes` models.

Your answer...

```
a schema is what we feed into a sql database before we feed it instances of that schema in order to populate a chart with those things. basically it lets the database know what kind of thing we are about to feed to it and what kinds of properties those things have and what kinds of limitations there are on what can be values of those properties (for instance: no strings, only floats, must be unique etc.)

the best way to represent a one to many relationship is to assign an id trait to the thing that there is one of (say, persons) and then to assign to the same id number to each one of the many things assigned to that one (for instance, by assigning a 'person_id' trait to each 'wish' and then to make sure that the 'person_id' trait of the wish is the same as the persons 'id' trait)
```

### Question 7

Consider a class `Person` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and has the following schema...

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
)
```

Write Ruby code that will create an instance of a person.

Your answer...

```ruby
isaac = Person.create(name: "Isaac", age: 24)
```

Write Ruby code that will query for any person that is 15 years of age.

Your answer...

```ruby
Person.find_by
```

### Question 8

Write a route in Sinatra that will print "hello world" in the web browser at the following URL: `http://localhost:4567/oh_hello`

Your answer...

```ruby
get '/oh_hello' do
  return 'hello world'
end
```
