## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby

def offer_rose (person)
puts "Would you like to take this rose, #{person}, in exchange fro giving an old begger woman shelter from the bitter cold?"
end

offer_rose('young prince')


```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby

town.update



```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby

def belle(friends)
  friends.each do |friend|
    puts "Bell is friends with #{friend}"
  end
end

```
## Ruby OOP (meets Lion King)

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`.
Each `Animal` should have:

- a `name` attribute
- a `greet` instance method
- Getter and setter for `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba"

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class.
The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have:
- a `king` attribute which is a boolean
  - If the instance's `name` is `Simba` make the `king` attribute true

Create a new lion instance with the name `simba`

```ruby
class Animal
attr_accessor name

  def initialize name
    @name = name
  end

def greet
  "Hi, my name is #{@name}"
end

# run these two commands
pumba = Animal.new "pumba"
pumba.greet

class Lion < Animal
attr_accessor :king
@@pack = pack

def initialize
  @king = true
end

def king?
if @name = "simba"
  @king
end

end
simba = Lion.new king
simba.king?

```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
ERD is an entity relationship diagram - shows the relations between entities in a database. It's shown as a diagram.

Genie - name, color
Genie and Lamp and ONE TO ONE relationshipo

Lamp - location

Pet - name, species, gender

Person - name, age, gender
PERSON can be a one to MANY pets

```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema can be descibe as a catalog of objects, it contains tables, views, relationships and privileges.

We repersent a one to many by using lines. A straight line that connects to a line that has "fingers" on it is how we visualize a one-to-many relationship. Straight line part of the line is the one and the "fingers" are the many.

An example of this is ONE coach to MANY football players.

```
