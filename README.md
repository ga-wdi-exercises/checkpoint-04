## Instructions

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Fill in your answers by writing in the appropriate area or, for multiple-choice questions, placing an 'x' in the square brackets.
4. Add/Commit/Push your changes to Github.
5. Open a pull request.

For questions 1-4, you must test your code before filling in an answer. You can do this by creating and running your own `app.rb` file or using an online REPL (e.g., [repl.it](https://repl.it/)).

## Ruby Basics & Enumerables

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here...

```ruby
def offer_rose(person)
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}?"
end
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash...

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby...
- Remove Belle from the town residents
- Add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here...

```ruby
belle = town[:residents].slice!(1)
town[:castle][:guests].push(belle)
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names...

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` and string interpolation, `puts` the following text...

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here...

```ruby
friends.each do |friend|
  puts "Bell is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## Ruby OOP

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`. Each `Animal` should have...
- A `name` attribute
- A `greet` instance method
- The ability to "get" and "set" `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba".

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have...
- A `king` attribute which is a boolean
- If the instance's `name` is "Simba" make the `king` attribute `true`

Create a new lion instance with the name "Simba".

```ruby

class Animal
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello I'm an animal and my name is #{name}"
  end

  def get_name
    @name
  end

  def set_name(newName)
    @name = newName
  end
end

class Lion < Animal
  attr_accessor :name, :pack, :king

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @pack = []
    @pack.push(self)
    @king = false

    if @name == "Simba"
      @king = true
    end
  end

  def get_pack
    @pack
  end
end


pumba = Animal.new("pumba")
simba = Lion.new("Simba")
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD)...
- Genie
- Lamp
- Person
- Pet

Your answer...

```
An ERD is a relationship diagram that helps developers better organize classes by how they relate to each other. For example, a person can have a lamp(one to many). A lamp can have a single genie(one to one). And any number of people can Pet any number of lamps (many to many)
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use `people` and `wishes` models.

Your answer...

```
A schema is a framework for how things should be organized. For example a person can have more than one wish(one to many)
```

### Question 7

Consider a class `Person` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and has the following schema...

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
)
```

Write Ruby code that will create an instance of a person.

Your answer...

```ruby
person = Person.new(id=01, name="Adam", age=20)
```

Write Ruby code that will query for any person that is 15 years of age.

Your answer...

```ruby
SELECT persons WHERE age > 15;
```

### Question 8

Write a route in Sinatra that will print "hello world" in the web browser at the following URL: `http://localhost:4567/oh_hello`

Your answer...

```ruby
get '/oh_hello'
  "hello world"
end
```
