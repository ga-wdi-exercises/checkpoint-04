# An ERD is an entity relationship diagram. It is a diagram used to visualize the data relating to the entitites that exist in our programs
#
# A genie would have attriubutes such as name and color. Among their own separate attributes a person and lamp would
# have a genie ID attribute to indicate the genie that they are assigned to. Finally, the pet entitiy would have its own
# collection of attributes, one of them being personID, indicating the person it belongs to.

#6_____________________

# A schema defines the columns of a table in a database. In the genie example, a person entity would have a one to many
# relationship with the wishes entity. We would draw this with the "hand lines" in our ERD diagram. The schema for a wish would
# likely include, wish name, person ID, wish text, etc.
